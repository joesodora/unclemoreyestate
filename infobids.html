YOUR BID: Enter your bid. Bids must be a value between $5,000 and $995,000 in multiples of $5,000 (5 to 995). Your entry will be averaged with the entries of all players. The averaged bid value will be the one used for this Round. Your bid will be compared to the average bid. If your bid is less than the average bid, you will receive the difference as income. If your bid is more than the average, you will pay that amount. (Higher bidders pay the lower bidders to advance farther and collect more tokens.)<br><br>

NOTE: If you enter a bid that is already taken, your bid will be reduced by $1,000. If more than one player's bid has been reduced to the same amount, the game will randomly choose which of those bids takes precedence. <br><br>

Here are some suggested high bids. Be aware that these amounts will vary greatly based on the token value. Also, if players are bidding aggressively, you may not want to limit yourself to these numbers.<br><br>

Suggested high bids:<br>
- 5 Players: &nbsp;&nbsp;$125,000<br>
- 6 Players: &nbsp;&nbsp;$150,000<br>
- 7 Players: &nbsp;&nbsp;$175,000<br>
- 8 Players: &nbsp;&nbsp;$250,000<br>
- 9 Players: &nbsp;&nbsp;$350,000<br>
- 10 Players: $500,000
