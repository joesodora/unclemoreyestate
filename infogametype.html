GAME TYPE: Select one of three options: Private Group, Public Group or Solo. Private Group for people planning to play the game together (You don't have to be in the same physical location.) Public Group for anyone who happens to be looking for a public group to join at the time you are starting the game. Solo if you want to play the game yourself. The game will create phantom players to "play" with you. <br>
