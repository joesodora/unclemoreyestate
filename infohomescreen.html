Home: This is where it all begins. You can start or join a game from here. Once a game has been started, information about the game and players is dispayed. You can come back to this screen to clear the game. This can be done after the game is over or if you are the host, while the game is still being played.<br><br>

You have 2 hours to complete the game. This is more than enough time to play. If you want to preserve the players' final totals, print the Stats screen after the game is over.<br><br>

And most importantly - ENJOY!!!!!
