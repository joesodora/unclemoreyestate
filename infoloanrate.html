LOAN RATE: Enter a Loan Rate. Your entry will be averaged with the entries of all players. The averaged rate will be the Loan Rate used for this cycle. <br><br> Loans rates are applied every Round to all players with balances less than $0.00. Since players start with no money, the highest bidders will have loans, at least during the first cycle. These loan balances will most likely be "paid off" when tokens are sold at the end of the cycle.<br>
