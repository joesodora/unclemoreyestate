NUMBER OF PLAYERS: Select the total number of players including "phantom" players. Example: You want to play the game as a private group but you only have 4 people. You can select any number between 5 and 10 here. If you select 6 for instance, the game will create 2 phantom players to add to your 4 "real" players.<br><br>

This feature allows you to play solo. In that case, you have 1 real player (yourself) and you can still play with 5 to 10 players.
