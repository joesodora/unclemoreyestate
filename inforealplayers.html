NUMBER OF REAL PLAYERS: Select the total number of real players not including "phantom" players. Example: You want to play the game as a private group and you only have 4 people. You would select 4 here. The number you enter cannot be greater than the previous field entry (Number of Players). It can be the same, however, if you have at least 5 people playing.<br>
