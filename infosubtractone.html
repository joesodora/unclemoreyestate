SUBTRACT ONE TOKEN: The default is to subtract one token each time a player lands on or crosses a token point. If you change this to 'No', the game will keep the same number of tokens available at each Token Point. This will change the dynamics of the game. It will take away the advantage of being the first to move. However, it will still be advantageous to move farther along the board. The top bids should not be as high though. Try it and see.<br>
